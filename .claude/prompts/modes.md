# Mode Selector

From the home screen, when you press the Play button, it currently takes you to
the large level map. We want to add a new screen that comes between the play
button and the large level map. This is going to be the mode selection screen.

The mode selection screen lets you pick Easy, Medium, or Hard mode.

Easy mode is what the game currently is, for levels 1 to 10.

Medium mode is for levels 11 to 20. It is unlocked if the highest level reached
is 10 or higher. **On all levels for medium mode, the clock has 1 minute instead
of 2.** When the user presses the Medium mode button, it shows the large level
map for levels 11–20. The semantics for large level map are exactly the same as
for easy mode. The user can enter any level that they've already reached. They
can't enter levels that they have not yet reached - they have to beat the
previous level first.

Hard mode is for levels 21–30. Here the timer is just 30 seconds. This option is
unlocked if the highest level reached is 20 or higher.

If any of this is ambiguous or unclear, ask clarifying questions before forming
a plan.
