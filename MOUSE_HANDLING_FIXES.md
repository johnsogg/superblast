# Mouse Handling Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Canvas Size Inconsistency**
**Problem**: The resize handler in `Game.ts` was setting canvas dimensions differently than the initial setup in `main.ts`, causing coordinate system mismatches.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `setupResizeHandler()` to use identical sizing logic as `main.ts`
- Added `updateCanvasSize()` method that maintains consistency
- Ensured canvas CSS dimensions match internal dimensions

### 2. **Canvas Display vs Internal Size Mismatch**
**Problem**: Canvas internal size (width/height properties) could differ from display size (CSS dimensions), causing `getBoundingClientRect()` to return incorrect coordinates.

**Fix**:
- Added explicit CSS width/height setting to match internal dimensions
- Added validation to detect size mismatches
- Enhanced logging for canvas dimension changes

### 3. **Coordinate Conversion Robustness**
**Problem**: `getPositionFromPixel()` had insufficient validation and debugging capabilities.

**Fix**:
- Added input validation for pixel coordinates
- Added checks for invalid cellSize
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added coordinate conversion debugging

### 4. **Debugging Infrastructure**
**Problem**: Difficult to diagnose mouse handling issues, especially coordinate conversion problems.

**Fix**:
- Created `DebugUtils.ts` with comprehensive logging utilities
- Added global debug functions accessible from browser console
- Integrated debug logging throughout mouse handling pipeline
- Added coordinate accuracy testing

## Files Modified

1. **src/Game.ts**
   - Fixed `setupResizeHandler()` canvas sizing logic
   - Added `updateCanvasSize()` method with consistency checks
   - Added canvas size validation on initialization
   - Integrated debug logging

2. **src/main.ts**
   - Added explicit CSS dimension setting
   - Enhanced canvas initialization logging

3. **src/Renderer.ts**
   - Enhanced `calculateDimensions()` with validation
   - Improved `getPositionFromPixel()` with error handling
   - Added `validateCanvasSize()` method
   - Added `testCoordinateAccuracy()` method
   - Integrated debug logging

4. **src/InputHandler.ts**
   - Enhanced mouse event handlers with debug logging
   - Improved coordinate tracking and validation

5. **src/DebugUtils.ts** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive debug utility class
   - Global debugging interface
   - Mouse event and coordinate conversion logging
   - Canvas validation utilities

## How to Use Debug Features

Open browser console and type:

```javascript
// Show available debug commands
SuperblastDebug.help()

// Enable detailed mouse event logging
SuperblastDebug.enableDebug()

// Check canvas size consistency
SuperblastDebug.validateCanvas()

// Test coordinate conversion (enables debug mode)
SuperblastDebug.testCoordinates()

// Disable debug logging
SuperblastDebug.disableDebug()
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Canvas Size Changes**: Resize the browser window and verify coordinates remain accurate
2. **High-DPI Displays**: Test on screens with different device pixel ratios
3. **Cell Click Accuracy**: Click near cell boundaries to ensure correct cell selection
4. **Drag Operations**: Verify drag operations work correctly across different screen sizes

## Key Improvements

- **Consistent Canvas Sizing**: Eliminates size mismatches between initial setup and resize
- **Better Error Handling**: Prevents coordinate conversion failures from causing crashes
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Makes it easy to diagnose coordinate issues in development
- **Robust Validation**: Detects and warns about potential coordinate system problems
- **Future-Proof**: Debug infrastructure helps quickly identify new coordinate issues

The fixes address the root causes of mouse coordinate issues while providing tools to quickly diagnose and fix any future problems.
